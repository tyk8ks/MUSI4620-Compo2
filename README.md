# MUSI4620-Compo2

This is my first draft of our Final Composition. My objectives for my final draft are:

- create a more flowing musical aspect ( I would like to create something a bit more melodic )
- more scripts to create different object manipulations ( I want to try changing the scale of things )
- incorporate dynamic shaders
